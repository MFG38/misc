Bash scripts that I use to generate text files with statistics
of Doom speedruns I've recorded by wad or category.

gen-demos-by-wad.sh:
  Generates demo counts by wad by going to each wad's subfolder
  and scanning the number of .lmp files therein.

gen-demos-by-category.sh:
  Coming soon. Hopefully.
