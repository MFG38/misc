A small batch script I wrote to automate zipping up Doom demos
and their text files for submission to DSDA.

NOTE: This script lacks the usual 7za.exe that I use for the
zipping functionality. You'll need to download it yourself and
place it in the proper folder or edit the line indicated in the
script to modify the path to it.
